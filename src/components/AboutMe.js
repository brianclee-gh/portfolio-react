        <p> Hey, I'm Brian! I'm a former dentist looking for a big change in
          my career. My coding journey started a year ago while stuck at home
          during the 2020 pandemic. With not much else to do, a friend recommended
          that I learn web development through <a href='https://theodinproject.com/'>The Odin
          Project's</a> Full Stack Javascript Cirriculum.
          <br />
          I got hooked. There was so much to learn and so many different ways to
          create whatever I wanted. It was an amazing difference from the
          monotonous worklife I was used to.
          <br />
          I decided to make a huge leap and am currently in Hack Reactor's
          Software Engineering Immersive. </p>
